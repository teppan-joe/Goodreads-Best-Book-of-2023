## About
This is a mini Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) python project to analyse Goodreads Best Book of 2023. This data is a combination of the final Goodreads Choice Awards winners and finalists and detailed information from Goodreads about the book, including the Number of Reviews, Average Reviewer Rating, Book Description and other details about the book. Goodreads readers vote on the nominated books. 5,879,213 votes were cast in 2023 across 15 genre categories, and 299 books made the final list.

This project covers basic steps in data analysis using pandas such as reading, analysing, data cleaning, grouping, and visualizing.
